# 2026-02-28 — Hierarchical Memory Implementation

## Session: Hierarchical Memory System

### Implemented
- Created hierarchical memory structure:
  - `memory/people/x.md` — User profile extracted from USER.md
  - `memory/projects/apex.md` — Project details extracted from AGENTS.md
  - `memory/decisions/2026-02.md` — Monthly decisions log
  - `MEMORY.md` — Rebuilt as lightweight index

### QMD System
- Created `qmd.js` — SQLite + FTS5 memory system
- Created `qmd-vector.js` — Vector search with embeddings

### Files Modified
- AGENTS.md — Updated Every Session with hierarchical memory rules
- USER.md — Simplified to pointer

### Next
- Test drill-down loading
- Verify token savings
- Set up QMD API service
