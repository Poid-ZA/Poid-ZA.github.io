# Decisions — March 2026

## 2026-03-01

### Capability Evolver Installed
- **Decision:** Implement self-evolution skill from OpenClaw skill registry
- **Source:** `openclaw/skills/opencloseopenclose/capabilityevolver1037`
- **Files:** `skills/capability-evolver/{index.js, evolve.js, SKILL.md}`
- **Function:** Introspect logs → fix/crystallize → commit
- **Risk:** Infinite recursion (mitigated: single process, no child spawning)

### Ralph Loop Mode Implemented
- **Decision:** Add loop detection to IDENTITY.md
- **Max iterations:** 10
- **Verification script:** `scripts/verify.sh`
- **Log:** `memory/ralph-loop-log.md`

### Token Optimization Rules Added to AGENTS.md
- No re-reading files after creation
- No re-running commands with known outcomes
- Cache reasoning within session
- Batch related edits

### Workspace Remote Changed
- **From:** `Poid-ZA/thor-defence` (deleted/missing)
- **To:** `Poid-ZA/Poid-ZA.github.io`
- **Issue:** PAT embedded in remote URL — should use credential helper instead

### Security: GitHub PAT Removed from Remotes
- **Context:** PAT was hardcoded in wigle-dashboard remote URL
- **Fix:** Changed to bare `https://github.com/...` + `.git-credentials` file
- **Note:** Workspace remote still has PAT embedded — needs cleanup

### Thor Defence Repo Missing
- **Context:** `Poid-ZA/thor-defence` returns 404
- **Possible cause:** Repo was created earlier in session but may have been deleted or creation failed
- **Action needed:** Recreate repo or verify GitHub account

### APEX Website Updated
- **Content added:** Overview stats, Memory Architecture, Skills Framework, Projects section
- **Pushed to:** `Poid-ZA/Poid-ZA.github.io` (master branch)
