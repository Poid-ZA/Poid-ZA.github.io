# 2026-03-01 — Session Log

## Work Done

### QMD & Memory (carried from 2026-02-28)
- Hierarchical memory v2.0 operational
- QMD files: `qmd.js`, `qmd-vector.js`

### Capability Evolver
- Installed from `openclaw/skills/opencloseopenclose/capabilityevolver1037`
- Created: `skills/capability-evolver/{index.js, evolve.js, SKILL.md}`
- Created: `memory/KNOWLEDGE_BASE/` directory
- First run: 0 errors, 0 corrections, 1 decision record found
- Auto-committed changes

### Ralph Loop Mode
- Added to IDENTITY.md
- Created `scripts/verify.sh` (demo logic)
- Created `memory/ralph-loop-log.md`
- Demo run: 3 iterations → PASS → APEX_RALPH_COMPLETE

### Token Optimization
- Added rules to AGENTS.md (no re-reads, no redundant commands, batch edits)

### WiGLE Dashboard
- Rewrote index.html (350 lines, all functions)
- Pushed to `Poid-ZA/wigle-dashboard`
- Fixed: drag-and-drop, CSV/KML import, all filter functions

### Thor Defence Website
- Redesigned with TCAT layout
- Files: `thor-defence/{index.html, styles.css, scripts.js}`
- **Issue:** Repo `Poid-ZA/thor-defence` does not exist on GitHub (404)

### APEX Website (Poid-ZA.github.io)
- Updated index.html with new sections
- Pushed to `Poid-ZA/Poid-ZA.github.io` on master branch

### Security
- Removed PAT from wigle-dashboard remote
- Fixed thor-defence remote (was pointing to wigle-dashboard)
- **Remaining issue:** workspace remote has PAT in URL

## Issues Encountered
1. Exec approval delays — commands queued but not processed for minutes
2. thor-defence repo missing from GitHub
3. Workspace remote pointed to wrong repo (thor-defence → github.io)
4. PAT still embedded in workspace remote URL
5. Duplicate files: `memory/people/The_One.md` and `memory/people/x.md` contain identical content

## Next
- Clean PAT from workspace remote URL
- Recreate thor-defence repo on GitHub
- Deduplicate people files (The_One.md vs x.md)
- Update MEMORY.md index with March decisions
- Run Capability Evolver to verify knowledge crystallization
